This file is the extrapony counterpart to the pony-checklist.
If you find a non-MLF:FiM pony you would like to be included,
you can list it here, instead of making a pony request in the
issue system, especially if you have many ponies and have
write access to this repo (or is making a pull request anyway).

Ponysonas or OC from the Ponysay Developers (You have one?, I have one)

	(Ponysona is a pormateau/Contraccion of: Pony and Persona, mean a special OC that identify yourself and is sed por either personal use or/and in RPG, draws, commissions, avatar u other things, this idea was taken from the Furry Fandom where they have Fursonas that is the same idea but extended to any apossible (or impossible) animal (like a pony too))
