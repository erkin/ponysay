This is my fork of https://github.com/erkin/ponysay
I really liked the concept, but I sort-of WTF-ed at the 2458-line python script powering it. So I rewrote the thing from scratch in actual python (not that bad since most of the work is done by util-say). Also, I missed a "--center"-option, so I added one. This rewrite is 117 lines long, and that includes the 7 original bubble styles which now are embedded in the python script. This means 95.2% less bloat, which I consider a success. Also, the rewrite is about 50-85% faster.

Fork me on github: https://github.com/jaseg/ponysay

The repo now also contains a small script for providing PAAS (Ponies As A Service) via the [QOTD protocol defined in RFC 865](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865).

FAQ
---

__Q:__ The output looks like a mess in `TTY/PuTTY/other`

__A:__ Yeah, sorry. If you find a fix, send me a pull request.

__Q:__ Which programs do you use to generate the pony files?

__A:__ The pony files are actually mostly a bunch of selected [browser ponies](http://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/~e0427417/browser-ponies/ponies.html), converted using [util-say](https://github.com/maandree/util-say).

Conversion
----------
Convert the old quote format with
```
for line in $(cat ponyquotes/ponies|grep +); do n=${line%%+*}; for a in $(sed s/+/\\n/g<<<${line#*+}); do ln -s quotes/${n}.quotes quotes/${a}.quotes; done; done
```
Afterwards, clean up the broken symlinks with ```find -L quotes -type l -delete```
