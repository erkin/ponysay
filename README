Installation on GNU/Linux (or other Unix implementations)
=========================================================

    Before installing ponysay, make sure your system have the packages listed under
    [Required runtime dependencies] and [Package building dependencies] installed.
    
    Download or clone the project.  bleeding edge:  https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/tarball/master
    	     	      	  	    release:        https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/tags
    
    In the terminal, `cd` into the ponysay directory and execute `make && make install`.
    This will install ponysay into the $PREFIX (/usr by default, meaning you may need to
    run `make install` as root, e.g. by running `sudo make install`.)
    
    In order to use ponysay, run:                 ponysay "I am just the cutest pony!"
    Or if you have a specific pony in your mind:  ponysay -f pinkie "Partay!~"
    
    Run `info ponysay`, `man 6 ponysay` (man ponysay) or `ponysay -h` for more information.
    A Spanish manual is available: man -L es 6 ponysay


Pony fortune on terminal startup
================================

    This requires that you have fortune utility installed. You can install it from your
    distributions package repository, it should be named fortune or fortune-mod.
    
    Edit your ~/.bashrc and this line [to the end should work]:
    
        fortune | ponysay
    
    Now every time you open a terminal a pony should give your fortune.
    
    If you wany ponified fortuned the are some stuff you can try:
        
        A gigantic sed script:

FAQ
===

    Q: The output looks like a mess in (TTY/PuTTY/other)!
    
    A: Unfortunately, there's nothing much we can do about it.
       See issue 1:  https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/issues/1
    
    Q: You are missing (my-favourite-pony)!
    
    A: Ask and we'll add!
       https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/issues
    
    Q: Which programs do you use to generate the pony files?
    
    A: The pony files are actually mostly a bunch of selected browser
       ponies that are generated into cow files via img2xterm
         https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm
       or util-say.
         https://github.com/maandree/util-say
         https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=60241


Providing ponies
================

    Most pony images are browser ponies or desktop ponies,
    browser ponies is a port of desktop ponies, implementing it in JavaScript.
    
    Browser ponies:  https://github.com/panzi/Browser-Ponies
    Desktop ponies:  http://desktop-pony-team.deviantart.com/
    
    There is also a collection of ponies that are not yet pixelated in a Java reimplementation:
      https://github.com/maandree/unisay/tree/develop/dev/newponies
    
    
    New ponies can be created from regular images by using img2xterm
      https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm
    or util-say
      https://github.com/maandree/util-say
      https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=60241
    
    Using util-say:
        
        img2ponysay -c 1 -2 -- SOURCE_IMAGE > PONY_FILE
        
        PONY_FILE should end with .pony and be localed in ponies/
        
        Omit -2 if the source image does not use double pixel size.
        
        (`-c 1` is no longer required.)
        For more information see https://github.com/maandree/util-say/wiki/img2ponysay
    
    When a pony is added please also add a ttypony version, but if you don't please
    state so in the pull request so we do not miss the create it; the simplest way to
    do this is to run `make -B ttyponies` after adding the ponies to ponies/.
    
    Running `make -B ttyponies` will build (or rebuild) all ttyponies with a pony present
    in ponies/, and creates all needed symlinks.
    
    To be able to run `make -B ttyponies` you must have the packages listed under
    [Dependencies for pony providers].
