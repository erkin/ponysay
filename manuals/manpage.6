.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBponysay\fP displays an image of a pony saying some text provided by the user in a terminal.
It is a wrapper for \fIcowsay\fP. If \fImessage\fP is not provided, it accepts standard input,
word-wraps the message given at about 40 columns, and prints the pony saying the given message on standard output.
.PP
If no arguments are provided, the program only accepts standard input piped from another program, a file or
either here documents or here strings (see man bash(1) for details on here document/string.)
.PP
\fBponythink\fP is to \fIponysay\fP as \fIcowthink\fP is to \fIcowsay\fP.

.B PONYSAY_BOTTOM
Under TTY (Linux VT), if the output is larger the the screen's height, only the beginning is
printed, leaving two blank lines. If you want the buttom to be printed rather the the beginning
you can export \fIPONYSAY_BOTTOM\fP with the value \fIyes\fP, \fIy\fP or \fI1\fP.
.TP
.B PONYSAY_SHELL_LINES
Under TTY (Linux VT), if the output is larger the the screen's height, two lines are left blank.
If you want more, or less, blank lines you can export \fIPONYSAY_SHELL_LINES\fP with the value
of how many blank lines you want. Naturally this takes effect if the output is not actually larger
than the screen.
.TP
.B PONYSAY_FULL_WIDTH
You can export \fIPONYSAY_FULL_WIDTH\fP with the value \fIno\fP, \fIn\fP or \fI0\fP, if you
do not want the output to be truncated on the width to fit the terminal.
.TP
.B PONYSAY_TRUNCATE_HEIGHT
Export \fIPONYSAY_TRUNCATE_HEIGHT\fP with the value \fIyes\fP, \fIy\fP or \fI1\fP, if you
want to truncate the output on the height even if you are not running \fIponysay\fP under TTY.
