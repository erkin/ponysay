@node Overview
@chapter Overview
@cindex overview

@command{ponysay} displays an image of a My Little Pony pony saying some text provided
by the user in a terminal, or a quote from the series. It is a wrapper for
@command{cowsay}. If message is not provided, e.g. by piping, it accepts standard input.
The pony saying the given message is printed on standard output.

@command{ponythink} is to @command{ponysay} as @command{cowthink} is to @command{cowsay}.

@command{ponysay} is generally used to decorate your terminal with a random pony, when
you start the terminal.




@node Invoking ponysay
@chapter Invoking @command{ponysay}
@cindex invoking
@cindex options
@cindex arguments
@cindex ponythink

The format for running the @command{ponysay} program is:

@example
ponysay [@var{option}@dots{}] [--] [@var{message}]
ponythink [@var{option}@dots{}] [--] [@var{message}]
@end example

Running @command{ponysay} will print a speech balloon,
@command{ponythink} will print a thought balloon.
Otherwise @command{ponysay} and @command{ponythink} is the same thing.

@command{ponysay} supports the following options:

@table @option

@item --
@cindex @command{--}
Parse the following arguments as parts of @code{@var{message}}.

@item -h
@cindex @command{-h}
Show summary of options.

@item -v
@cindex @command{-v}
Show version of program.

@item -f PONY
@cindex @command{-f}
Specify the pony that should printed, this can either be a file name or
a pony name printed by @command{ponysay -l}. If it is a file name with
a relative path and does not include a `@code{/}', it must begin with
`@code{./}', this is a @command{cowsay} issue. This option can be used
multiple times to specify a set of ponies from which one will be selected
randomly. If no pony is specified one will be selected randomly.

@item -q [PONY...]
@cindex @command{-q}
By using this option, a pony will be printed with quotes from her in My Litte Pony:
Friendship is Magic. The pony will be selected randomly, unless at least one pony
is added as an argument after @command{-q}. If one or more ponies are added after
@command{-q}, the pony will be selected randomly from that set of ponies.
This option requires the extension @command{ponyquotes4ponysay}, which
is included by default since version 1.2.

@item -W COLUMN
@cindex @command{-W}
Specify the screen column where the message should be wrapped,
this is by default 40, which is inherited from @command{cowsay}.

@item -l
@cindex @command{-l}
Lists all installed ponies. If the extension @command{ponyquotes4ponysay}
is installed the ponies which have quotes, i.e. can be used with the
@command{-q} option, will be mark by being printed in bold or bright
(depending on the terminal.)

@item -L
@cindex @command{-L}
Lists all installed ponies. If the extension @command{ponyquotes4ponysay}
is installed the ponies which have quotes, i.e. can be used with the
@command{-q} option, will be mark by being printed in bold or bright
(depending on the terminal.) This options differs from @command{-l} by
printing alternative names (symbolic links) inside brackets after their
target ponies.
@end table

If neither @command{-q} is used nor any @var{message} is specified, @command{ponysay}
will read the message from stdin (standard input); however, if no arguments
are used that nothing is piped to stdin, a help message will be printed.
If you want to use @command{ponysay} without arguments and enter the message
by hand, you can run @code{cat | ponysay}.

@cindex startup
@cindex on startup
@cindex .bashrc

If you have @command{fortune} installed -- this program may be named
@command{fortune-mod} in your GNU/Linux distributions package reposity --
you can run @code{fortune | ponysay} to get a random pony reading a
random fortune cookie.

By adding @code{fortune | ponysay} to the end [easiest way] of your
@code{~/.bashrc} -- or equivalent for your shell if use do not use GNU Bash
(standard shell for most distributions now adays) -- you will get the
effect described in the previous paragraph every time you open a terminal.


@node Ponification
@section Ponification
@cindex ponification
@cindex text ponification
@cindex ponypipe

You can ponify text (i.e. replaces words search as ``everyone'' with ``everypony'')
by using @code{fortune | ponypipe} instead of using @command{fortune}.
@command{ponypipe} can be downloaded from @url{https://github.com/maandree/ponypipe}.
Alternatively use can use @command{pinkie} (or @command{pinkiepie}), which can
be downloaded from @url{https://github.com/maandree/pinkie-pie}, which is just
@code{fortune | ponypipe}.
There is also a large sed script, similar to @command{ponypipe}: @url{http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlelinux/comments/srixi/using_ponysay_with_a_ponified_fortune_warning/}


@node Running on TTY
@section Running on TTY
@cindex tty
@cindex linux vt
@cindex .bashrc

If you use TTY and have a custom colour palette, you should also add to your
@code{~/.bashrc}, before @code{fortune | ponysay}:
@example
[[ "$TERM" = "linux" ]] &&
    function ponysay
    @{   exec ponysay "$@@"
        #RESET PALETTE HERE
    @}
@end example


@node Running on screen
@section Running on @command{screen}
@cindex screen
@cindex .bashrc

@command{screen} will adapt ASNI colour escape sequences to your terminal's
capabilities. This means that if your terminal reports itself as @code{xterm}
in @code{$TERM} ponies will lose their colours; they will only use the lower 16
colours instead of the top 240 colours. By default, almost all X terminals,
including @command{xterm} and @command{mate-terminal} reports themselves as
@code{xterm} in @code{$TERM}, and some reports their actual name in @code{$COLORTERM}.
So before opening @command{screen} you use set @code{$TERM} to @code{xterm-256color},
if you are using a terminal with support for @code{xterm}'s 256 colours; this
can be done by adding to your @code{~/.bashrc}:
@example
[[ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]] &&
    function screen
    @{   export TERM="xterm-256color"
        exec screen "$@@"
    @}
@end example



@node Environment variables
@chapter Environment variables
@cindex environment variables
@cindex truncation

@command{ponysay} supports the follow environment variables:

@table @option
@item PONYSAY_BOTTOM
@cindex PONYSAY_BOTTOM
@cindex tty
Under TTY (Linux VT), if the output is larger the the screen's height, only
the beginning is printed, leaving two blank lines. If you want the bottom
to be printed rather the the beginning you can export @code{PONYSAY_BOTTOM}
with the value @code{yes}, @code{y} or @code{1}.

@item PONYSAY_SHELL_LINES
@cindex PONYSAY_SHELL_LINES
@cindex tty
Under TTY (Linux VT), if the output is larger the the screen's height, two
lines are left blank. If you want more, or less, blank lines you can export
@code{PONYSAY_SHELL_LINES} with the value of how many blank lines you want.
Naturally this takes effect if the output is not actually larger than the
screen.
 
@item PONYSAY_FULL_WIDTH
@cindex PONYSAY_FULL_WIDTH
You can export @code{PONYSAY_FULL_WIDTH} with the value @code{yes}, @code{y}
or @code{1}, if you do not want the output to be truncated on the width to
fit the terminal.

@item PONYSAY_TRUNCATE_HEIGHT
@cindex PONYSAY_TRUNCATE_HEIGHT
Export @code{PONYSAY_TRUNCATE_HEIGHT} with the value @code{yes}, @code{y}
or @code{1}, if you want to truncate the output on the height even if you
are not running @command{ponysay} under TTY.

@item PONYSAY_COWSAY
@itemx PONYSAY_COWTHINK
@cindex PONYSAY_COWSAY
@cindex PONYSAY_COWTINK
@cindex custom cowsay
@cindex replace cowsay
If you want to use another program than @command{cowsay} (the first
@command{cowsay} found in @code{$PATH}), you can export @code{PONYSAY_COWSAY}
with the value of that program. If, and only if, @code{PONYSAY_COWSAY} does
not have any value, @command{cowsay} is patch with @code{use utf8;} to the
beginning. The @code{use utf8;} patch is introduced to make it easier to
customise cowsay.

@code{PONYSAY_COWTHINK} will be used instead of @code{PONYSAY_COWSAY} if
you run @command{ponythink}.

@node Terminals
@section Terminals
@cindex terminals
@cindex fonts
@cindex broken ponies

@cindex xterm
@cindex putty
Ponysay works perfectly on @command{xterm}, @command{xterm} like terminals including
@command{putty}, settings may however need to be customised for Unicode Character Set
(UCS) support, but less well, depending on font, on VTE based terminals including
@command{mate-terminal}.

@cindex kms
@cindex kernel mode settings
@cindex tty
@cindex linux vt
On Linux's native terminal Linux VT (TTY) it works less well, and not good at all with
Kernal Mode Settings (KMS) support. See @url{https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/issues/1}
for more information. @command{ponysay} clears the screen before printing to TTY, this
is because if your graphics driver supports KMS, the colours will be messed by when the
ponies position moves on the screen, this is also reason why the output is truncated on
the height in TTY by default.

Most terminals have support for 256 colours, we do however only use the top 240 colours;
this is because the lower 16 colours are usually, in contrast to the top 240, customised.
We assume that the top 240 colours have their standard values. In TTY with KMS support
we dot have any actual (except for @math{2^{24}} + full transparency.)

@cindex xterm
@cindex urxvt
@cindex putty
@cindex rxvt
@cindex mrxvt
@cindex Eterm
@cindex aterm
@command{ponysay} works perfectly on @command{xterm}, @command{urxvt} and @command{putty},
but @command{rxvt}, @command{mrxvt} and @command{Eterm} do not have UTF-8 support and are
currently not supported. Additionally @command{aterm} have neither UTF-8 support nor 256
colour support, and is therefore not yet support.

@cindex 9term
Due to extreme limitations in @command{9term} @command{ponysay} will never be able to
run on it.


@node Cowsay
@section Cowsay

When @command{cowsay} determines the length of a word it measures in number of bytes
(in UTF-8), therefore non-ASCII words will malformat the balloon with the message.

Further, @command{cowsay} does not recognise ANSI escape sequences, therefore, using
colours and text styling in messages will also malformat the balloon with the message.

@command{cowsay} does not support balloon, including the link between the message and
the pony, customisation, other than using @command{cowthink}. However you can modify
@command{cowsay} (written perl, so you can edit the installed files) to make the balloon
look different, maybe using box drawing characters.

@command{cowsay} does support setting the minimum size of the balloon, both directions
on the balloon–pony links. or any other placement of the balloon than at the top to
the left.

@cindex figlet
@cindex tiolet
@command{cowsay}'s word wrapping handles single line breaks as normal blank spaces,
this messes up messaged created with programs such as @command{figlet} and @command{TOIlet}.

Tarballs can be downloaded at @url{https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/tarball/master}
for bleeding edge, or from @url{https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/tags} for releases.

If you have @command{git} you @command{clone} the project URL
@url{https://github.com/erkin/ponysay.git}.

In the terminal,@command{cd} into the ponysay directory and execute
@command{make install}. This will install @command{ponysay} into the
@code{/usr}, meaning you may need to run @command{make install} as root,
e.g. by running @command{sudo make install}.

Now you will be to use ponysay, run: @command{ponysay "I am just the cutest pony!"},
or if have a specific pony in your mind: @command{ponysay -f pinkie "Partay!~"}.

@command{ponysay} comes with this @command{info} manual and a manpage in section 6,

@command{kmsponies4ponysay} is an extension for TTY users that have a custom TTY colour
palette and KMS support. KMS is supported on must computers, but due to lack of published
specifications Nvidea drivers does not support KMS. @command{kmsponies4ponysay} can be
downloaded at @url{https://github.com/maandree/kmsponies4ponysay}.

To use this extension your @code{~/.bashrc} (or equivalent for your shell) must keep track
of your colour palette, it is not possible for a program to ask to terminal. Either the
shell should export a palette string to @code{$PONYSAY_KMS_PALETTE} or you should export
a command to can get the palette string to @code{$PONYSAY_KMS_PALETTE_CMD}. The palette
string should be the stream which sets the colour palette to the terminal when
@command{echo}:ed; preferably, to increase speed and reduce cache usage, it should be
consistent everytime it is exported for every colours palette. So you may want to keep it
sorted, always be in either upper case or lower case, and not contain an character that
is not used to set the colour palette.

Assuming you have a function in your @code{~/.bashrc}, to reset the colour palette to what
you set it to last time in the terminal, named @command{reset-palette}, your @code{~/.bashrc}
should, for example, contain:
@example
[[ "$TERM" = "linux" ]] &&
    function ponysay
    @{   export PONYSAY_KMS_PALETTE="`reset-palette`"
        exec ponysay "$@@"

@command{kmsponies4ponysay} uses @code{/var/cache/kmsponies4ponysay/} for cache space.

@cindex anatomy of pony files

The pony files are cow files used by @command{cowsay}, they are partial Perl-scripts
that assign a value to a scalar variable named @code{$the_cow}. The files use a
predefined scalar named variable named @code{$thoughts}, these are used to create
a link between the message and the pony. The message (and the balloon) it self is
printed by @command{cowsay} and is not defined in the pony files.

The pony images consists of white space, lower half blocks [U+2584], upper half
blocks [U+2580] and ANSI colour sequences (CSI m), and, in TTY, colour value change
sequences (OSI P).

Since Linux VT (TTY) does not have capabilities for returning the pssition of the cursor,
the screen must always be cleared before printing the ponies to make sure the pony's
colours is not lost, i.e. reduced to mare 16 colours, during print. The colours are reduced
if the pony's position on the screen is changed. This is only relevant with KMS support.
The clear the screen we print ``@code{\e[H\e[2J}'' (@code{\e} is ESC) in at beginning.
``@code{\e[H}'' places the cursor at the beginning of the screen, and ``@code{\e[2J}'' clears
everything on the screen after, and including at, the cursor. If we would use ``@code{\ec}''
(that is a reset), we would also turn off num. lock and caps. lock.


@node Truncation
@section Truncation
@cindex truncation
@cindex output trunction
@cindex kms
@cindex kernel mode settings

Ponysay supports three type of output truncations, cutting away overflow on the right
and truncation the height by either keeping the bottom or keeping the top. By default
the latest is enabled under TTY, cutting away overflow on the right is always enabled
by default.

Truncating the height in TTY is required under Kernel Mode Settings (KMS) support to
keep the colours from being messed up ad the ponies is moved in the screen during
print; this done either by piping to @command{head} (keeps the top) or by piping to
@command{tail} (keeps the bottom.) @command{head} and @command{tail} takes as argument
the number of lines to keep at most.

The size of the terminal, measured in characters, is fetched from @command{stty size},
which returns @code{HEIGHT WIDTH}, and @command{cut} it the used to get either the
height or the width. This required on GNU Coreutils; earlier @command{tput rows} and
@command{tput cols} were used, this however required, the only de facto standard,
package @command{ncurses}, some shells have environment variables for this.

For truncation the width, we have a custom program, named @command{ponysaytruncater},
that is installed to @code{/usr/lib/ponysay/truncater}. It recognised UTF-8 ANSI escape
sequences, including OSI P and CSI m, which is essential for the truncation to be correct.
It also expands tabs to every eighth column and resets the background colour when needed,
and writes ANSI escape sequences that are on the left side of the truncation. The truncater
stops CSI sequences on the first ASCII letter (@code{[a-zA-Z]}), but also stops escape
sequences after the first character after the initial escape if it is not either @code{[}
(CSI) or @code{]} (OSI). For support UTF-8, to handles all bytes that do not match
@code{10xxxxxx} as beginning of a character.

Ponysay is written primarily in GNU Bash shell script (POSIX compliant); the truncater
is however written in C, because it is simple, fast, does not pose addition dependencies,
and is easy to do byte hacking in.

Sometimes shell is too slow, in these cases [that exist today] Perl is used; Perl
is already required by cowsay, is similar to shell, but also supports hash tables.
[maandree: I actually learned Perl just for this.]

@cindex create pony file

Most pony images are browser ponies or desktop ponies, browser ponies is a port of
desktop ponies, implementing it in JavaScript. Browser ponies are available at
@url{https://github.com/panzi/Browser-Ponies}. Desktop ponies are available at
@url{http://desktop-pony-team.deviantart.com/}.

There is also a collection of ponies that are not yet pixelated in a Java reimplementation:
@url{https://github.com/maandree/unisay/tree/develop/dev/newponies}

There is a checklist named @code{"pony-checklist"} at the top level of the project
directory. You can use the check which ponies are added and which are not.
@*

New ponies can be created from regular images by using util-say, which is available
at @url{https://github.com/maandree/util-say}.
@command{img2xterm} (@url{https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm}) was used earlier,
but util-say tries to optimise the images in some aspects: as good as possible for
low capability terminals, tries to place the pony–balloon link, displayed as good as
possible when marked in the terminal (somewhat compromised by the first aspect,) and
same width on all rows.

Using util-say:
@cindex util-say
@cindex img2ponysay
@example
img2ponysay -2 -- SOURCE_IMAGE > PONY_FILE

PONY_FILE should end with .pony and be localed in ponies/

Omit -2 if the source image does not use double pixel size.

For more information see:
@url{https://github.com/maandree/util-say/wiki/img2ponysay}
@end example

@cindex ttypony
When a pony is added please also add a ttypony version, i.e. the pony files used in TTY,
but if you don't please state so in the pull request so we do not miss the create it;
the simplest way to do this is to run @command{make -B ttyponies} after adding the ponies
to @code{ponies/}, running @command{make -B ttyponies} will build (or rebuild) all
ttyponies with a pony present in @code{ponies/}, and creates all needed symlinks.

To be able to run @command{make -B ttyponies} you must have the packages listed under
@ref{Dependencies for pony providers}.
