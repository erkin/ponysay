Discord is the mischievous spirit of Disharmony. Before my sister and I stood
up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest, and unhappiness.
Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns
alike. So after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our power and
rose up against him, turning him to stone!
