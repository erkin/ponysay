Discord is the mischievous spirit of Disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest, and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns alike. So after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our power and rose up against him, turning him to stone!

Gotcha!

These creatures are adorable!

I want you right by my side the entire evening.

Will you accept my friendship?
