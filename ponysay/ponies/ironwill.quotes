Never apologise, when you can criticise.

Treat me like a push-over, and you will get the once-over.

When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock.

Maybes are for babies.

You laugh at me? I wrath at you!

Cut in line? I will take what is mine.

You apologise, I penalise.

You make me lose, I blow my fuse.
