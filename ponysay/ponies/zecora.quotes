Beware! Beware you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

Have you gone mad?

Is that a parasprite before my eyes?

Your actions will make my anger explode!

My Lair! My Lair!

Ponies, what is this... No, you know not what you do. You've gone and spilled my precious brew.

How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my works, an then accuse me, of being a jerk?
